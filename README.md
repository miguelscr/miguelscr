# Hi, I’m Miguel Salvador Cruz Rodríguez, Backend Developer 👋
### I am a backend developer who has been working on Python, Java, SQL, MongoDB, Linux. I am passionate about working at a company to do software quality.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about python and java, but apart from that, I like to learn how to work on C++, C#, and Django.
💞️ I’m always learning more about technologies and methodologies because I never want to stop learning.
📫 You can contact me through Linkedin or email.
